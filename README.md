This is my firebase project to try get to know firebase better.

run npm install in the terminal

Create a bundle.js file in the 'dist' folder if it wasnt created.
Create a config.js file in the 'src' folder and add your firestore configs there.

Remember to write 'npm run build' in the terminal if you want to edit in the js.
